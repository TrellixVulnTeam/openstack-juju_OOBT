      By default this value will be set according to 50% of system total
      memory or 512MB (whichever is lowest) but also can be set to any specific
      value for the system.  Supported suffixes include K/M/G/T. If suffixed
      with %, one will get that percentage of system total memory allocated.
  innodb-change-buffering:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Configure whether InnoDB performs change buffering, an optimization
      that delays write operations to secondary indexes so that the I/O
      operations can be performed sequentially.

      Permitted values include

        none        Do not buffer any operations.
        inserts     Buffer insert operations.
        deletes     Buffer delete marking operations; strictly speaking,
                    the writes that mark index records for later deletion
                    during a purge operation.
        changes     Buffer inserts and delete-marking operations.

    description: |
      Configure the InnoDB IO capacity which sets an upper limit on I/O
      activity performed by InnoDB background tasks, such as flushing pages
      from the buffer pool and merging data from the change buffer.

      This value typically defaults to 200 but can be increased on systems
      with fast bus-attached SSD based storage to help the server handle the
      background maintenance work associated with a high rate of row changes.

      Alternatively it can be decreased to a minimum of 100 on systems with
      low speed 5400 or 7200 rpm spindles, to reduce the proportion of IO
      operations being used for background maintenance work.

  max-connections:
    type: int
    default: 600
    description: |
      Maximum connections to allow. A value of -1 means use the server's
      compiled-in default.  This is not typically that useful so the
      charm will configure PXC with a default max-connections value of 600.
      Note: Connections take up memory resources. Either at startup time with
      performance-schema=True or during run time with performance-schema=False.
      This value is a balance between connection exhaustion and memory
      exhaustion.
      Consult a MySQL memory calculator like http://www.mysqlcalculator.com/ to
      understand memory resources consumed by connections.
      See also performance-schema.
  wait-timeout:
    type: int
    default: -1

    default:
    description: |
      The IP address and netmask of the 'access' network (e.g. 192.168.0.0/24)

  prefer-ipv6:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True enables IPv6 support. The charm will expect network interfaces
      to be configured with an IPv6 address. If set to False (default) IPv4
      is expected.
      .
      NOTE: these charms do not currently support IPv6 privacy extension. In
      order for this charm to function correctly, the privacy extension must be
      disabled and a non-temporary address must be configured/available on
      your network interface.
  lp1366997-workaround:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      Adds two config options (wsrep_drupal_282555_workaround and

    default: 'juju'
    description: |
      Used by the nrpe-external-master subordinate charm. A string that will be
      prepended to instance name to set the host name in nagios. So for
      instance the hostname would be something like:
      .
        juju-myservice-0
      .
      If you're running multiple environments with the same services in them
      this allows you to differentiate between them.
  nagios_servicegroups:
    type: string
    default: ''

  enable-binlogs:
    default: False
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Turns on MySQL binary logs. The placement of the logs is controlled with
      the binlogs_path config option.
  binlogs-path:
    default: /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.log
    type: string
    description: |
      Location on the filesystem where binlogs are going to be placed.
      Default mimics what mysql-common package would do for mysql.
      Make sure you do not put binlogs inside mysql datadir (/var/lib/mysql/)!
  binlogs-max-size:
    default: 100M
    type: string
    description: |
      Sets the max_binlog_size mysql configuration option, which will limit the
      size of the binary log files. The server will automatically rotate binlgos
      after they grow to be bigger than this value.
      Keep in mind that transactions are never split between binary logs, so
      therefore binary logs might get larger than configured value.
  binlogs-expire-days:
    default: 10
    type: int
    description: |
      Sets the expire_logs_days mysql configuration option, which will make
      mysql server automatically remove logs older than configured number of
      days.
  performance-schema:
    default: False
    type: boolean
    description: |
      The performance schema attempts to automatically size the values of
      several of its parameters at server startup if they are not set
      explicitly. When set to on (True) memory is allocated at startup time.
      The implications of this is any memory related charm config options such
      as max-connections and innodb-buffer-pool-size must be explicitly set for
      the environment percona is running in or percona may fail to start.
      Default to off (False) at startup time giving 5.5 like behavior. The
      implication of this is one can set configuration values that could lead
      to memory exhaustion during run time as memory is not allocated at
      startup time.
  tuning-level:
    default: safest
    type: string
    description: |
      Valid values are 'safest', 'fast', and 'unsafe'. If set to 'safest', all
      settings are tuned to have maximum safety at the cost of performance.
      'fast' will turn off most controls, but may lose data on crashes. 'unsafe'
      will turn off all protections but this may be OK in clustered deployments.
